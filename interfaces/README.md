# Interfaces

Interfaces of the IBF-system.
- Visualization of model results (and auxiliary data) through dashboards
- Dashboards might in future move from read-only to write-applications, where users can also add (secondary) data through an interface 

## Setup

The main current example here is the `FBF Zambia interface`: https://fbf-zambia.510.global/ with code in `fbf-zambia`-branch in https://github.com/rodekruis/CommunityRisk/tree/fbf-zambia.

**MAJOR NOTE**: There is a very serious case to make for not continuing with this interface, and starting (partly) from scratch. This would mean not using the above code-base. As such it is for now not merged into this repository.
